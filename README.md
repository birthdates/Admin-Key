# Admin-Key
Get admin from a key code instead of going into console

## Configuration

```json
{
  "Entities that are denied from spawning (cant spawn, long prefab names accepted)": [
    "assets/content/vehicles/boats/rowboat/rowboat.prefab"
  ]
}
```

## Localization

```json
{
  "InvalidArgs": "/antientity remove|add <prefab>", "SuccessRemove": "You have successfully removed the prefab {0}", "SuccessAdd": "You have successfully added the prefab {0}", "DoesntExist": "That prefab is not in the list!", "NotAPrefab": "That is not a valid prefab."}```For prefab finding, you can use the [`Prefab Sniffer`](https://umod.org/plugins/prefab-sniffer) plugin.
